# This is a script to provide an audit trail of users permissions and model sets in Looker over time. 

#Create a look from System Activity > User explore that contains the following fields:
- User Name
- Role Name
- Model Set name
- Is Disabled (Yes/No)
- Is Admin (Yes/No)
- Is Explorer (Yes/No)
- Calculated "Date" with calcuation = date(extract_years(now()),extract_month(now()),extract_days(now()))
- Filter by is not "All Users" - not tied to permissions

#Schedule the look to be run once per day as an excel sheet.

#Run the following script to create a single excel for audit analysis

# import libraries
import os
import pandas as pd
from datetime import date

# import data
path = os.getcwd()
files = os.listdir(path)

files_xlsx = [a for a in files if a[-4:] == 'xlsx']

df1 = pd.DataFrame()

for a in files_xlsx:
  data1 = pd.read_excel(a,'sheet1')
  df1 = df1.append(data1)

# Data cleanup
df2 = df1.drop(columns = ['Unnamed:0'])
df3 = df2.rename(columns = {'Name':'User Name','Name.1':'Role Name','Name.2':'Model Set Name'})

# Rename and export the combined file
today = str(date.today())

writer = pd.ExcelWriter(today + '_CombinedData.xlsx', engine = 'xlsxrwriter')

df3.to_excel(writer,sheet_name = 'sheet1')

writer.save()
