# Info: Table calculations are calculations on top of the data from the database.
# They are useful for ad-hoc and bespoke analysis.
# It's adviseable to replace these with a dimension for repeatable queries or larger datasets beyond the 5000 row limit.

# Table calculations depend on the application but are very flexible.

# 1) Percent and Running Totals

${count_metric}/${count_metric:total}

running_total(${count_metric})

# 2) Checks of data

if (${count_metric>0,"Yes","No"})

pivot_index(${count_metric},4)

# 3) Multiple groupings within a custom dimension

if(${dimension_1} = "A" OR ${dimension_1} = "B","A or B",if(${dimension_1} = "C" OR ${dimension_1} = "C","C or D",${dimension_1}))

# 4) Hide to remove 0  values

${measure_1}<1

# 5) Analysis across pivot

${count_metric}/pivot_offset(${count_metric},1)

sum(pivot_row(${count_metric))

mean(pivot_row(${count_metric))

# 6) Handling nulls

if(is_null(${count_metric},0,1))

# 7) Percentile analysis

percentile(${count_metric},0.25)

median(${count_metric}}

percentile(${count_metric},0.75)

# 8) Check for matches between 2 dimensions where 1 has been pivoted 

coalesce(pivot_where(${dimension_1}=${dimension_2},${count_metric}),0)
